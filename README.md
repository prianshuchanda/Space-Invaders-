# Space-Invaders-
The goal of this project is to recreate the classic Space Invaders arcade game using Python and Pygame, helping beginners learn the fundamentals of 2D game development, including graphics rendering, user input handling, collision detection, and game loop logic.



üìå Project Title:
Space Invaders ‚Äì A Pygame-Based 2D Game

üìù Context & Description
This project is a simple 2D arcade-style shooting game inspired by the classic Space Invaders. It was developed using Python and Pygame, intended for learning purposes and as an introduction to game development with Python. The game features a player-controlled spaceship that can move horizontally and shoot enemies descending from the top of the screen.

This game project helps beginners understand the core components of game design: rendering, event handling, collision detection, and game loop management.
