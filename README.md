# Space-Invaders-
The goal of this project is to recreate the classic Space Invaders arcade game using Python and Pygame, helping beginners learn the fundamentals of 2D game development, including graphics rendering, user input handling, collision detection, and game loop logic.




üìå Project Title:
Space Invaders ‚Äì A Pygame-Based 2D Game
________________________________________
üìù Context & Description






This project is a simple 2D arcade-style shooting game inspired by the classic Space Invaders. It was developed using Python and Pygame, intended for learning purposes and as an introduction to game development with Python. The game features a player-controlled spaceship that can move horizontally and shoot enemies descending from the top of the screen.
This game project helps beginners understand the core components of game design: rendering, event handling, collision detection, and game loop management.

üîÅ Workflow / Game Flow




1.	Game Initialization:
o	Pygame modules are initialized.
o	Screen resolution and game window title/icon are set.
2.	Assets Loading:
o	Background image
o	Player image
o	Enemy images
o	Bullet image
o	Background music and sound effects
3.	Player Control:
o	Left and right arrow keys to move the player.
o	Space bar to shoot bullets.
4.	Enemy Movement:
o	Multiple enemies move left and right and descend after hitting the screen boundary.
o	New positions are calculated continuously in the game loop.
5.	Collision Detection:
o	Checks if a bullet hits an enemy.
o	If true, enemy resets and score increases.
6.	Score Display:
o	Real-time score display on the screen.
7.	Game Over Condition:
o	If any enemy reaches a certain vertical position near the player, the game ends.
8.	Game Loop:
o	Continuous refresh of screen, updates to positions, and event handling.
